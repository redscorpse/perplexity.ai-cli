# Perplexity.ai-CLI

> All merits to [Helpingai](https://github.com/HelpingAI/Helpingai_T2).

This is a simple script that lets you interact with [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) from the command line.

<div align="center"> <img src="ppl-ai.gif" width=500> </div>

USAGE:
1. You can easily use the installation script to use it as a binary file.
2. To send a question you need to press [Ctrl-d] on a blank line (great for pasting multiple lines)
3. Perplexity has the great feature of returning references, you can get them by sending `$refs`
4. [Ctrl-c] to quit (also exits the python-venv).
